# triplet

Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line of each test case contains an Integer denoting size of array and the second line contains N elements Output:

For each test case, print the count of all triplets, in new line. If no such triplets can form, print 1".

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100 3 <=NC= 10% 1 <=AN = 10 

Example:

Input:

2

4

1532

3

327

Output:

2

-1

Explanation:

Test Case 1: There are 2 triplets: 1 +2 = 3 and 3+2 = 5 Similarly. Other Test Cases can also be considered.
